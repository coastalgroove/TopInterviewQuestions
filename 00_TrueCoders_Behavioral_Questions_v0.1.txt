1.Tell Me about Yourself (30 to 45 sec)
I started in aerospace and after a layoff I even spent
a little time as professional musician then I backed into
IT installing and configuring routers/switchs and firewalls.
That group also did penetration testing and I decided to
take that path.

To be more successful at using exploits I needed to learn
how to read what they were doing and what software component
they were targeting, also many exploits require some customization
for the target so I began learning to read and write
C, PHP, Python, PERL, Java, Ruby, PowerShell

As time went on my creativity led me to design some of my
own exploits as well as offensive tools sHack was my first
a semi-automated attack framework for identifying weak targets
and launching attacks, then pwdFactory which was a psychological
profiling linguistic based password generator, then Injecta which
is designed to use the 1970 Bell labs C parser library common
to every computer and application in the world and use syntax
primitives like a software language desgined to get the parser
to do things the software devleoper never considered.

Family circumstances required we move to the Nashville area
and the classified world I had been in was no longer available
So I decided to embrace my love of creating software "liquid thought"
I call it and specialize in software and signed up for TrueCoders
9week Software Engineering Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
and here I am

--------------------------------------
2. What are your Strengths?
Adaptability, intense focus fast learner

-------------------------------------
3. What are your biggest Weaknesses?
My intense focus can cause me to communicate less and I am working on that


---------------------------------
4. Why do you want to work here
	The vision of XYZ company and
	the software technology  you
	specialize in appeals to me
	professinally and creatively
	I see opportunity for growth
	
------------------------------------
5. Why did you leave your last job?
Family circumstances required we move to the Nashville area
and the classified world I had been in was no longer available

------------------------------------
6. What is your Biggest Accomplishment?
Seeing, Conceiving of an overlooked
component of security and writing a
cyberwarfare tool that exploited it

Injecta, designed to use the 1970 Bell labs C parser library common
to every computer and application in the world and use syntax
primitives like a software language desgined to get the parser
to do things the software devleoper never considered.


----------------------------------------------------
7. Describe a difficult problem you were faced with
and what did you do to overcome it?
Teaching myself how to code, fortunately I enjoyed it
so it made it easier, I really enjoy watching
my thoughts come alive in functiong software

----------------------------------------------------
8. Where do you see yourself five years from now?
	Specializing in writing defensive and offensive software tools

----------------------------------------------------
9. Why Should we hire you?
	I am an over the horizon thinker.
	I am a subtractor, I avoid normalcy bias in my problem solving
	I'm a trained engineer with music skills and it gives
	me a unique approach to envisinoing software and problem solving	

----------------------------------------------------
10.Do you have any questions for me?

What design pattern does your team currently use?

How does your company orgaznization culture view the role of creativity
as an active ingredient in the group culture anad software design

How would you describe the software philosophy of your senior software engineer

Do software delivery promised dates take priority over testing?

What is the average length of time at your company for your developers

Do you have a program for funding outside certifications that relate
to learning new software design, attending software seminars and conventions
and does that include security as it applies to both built-in and active
skills used for dynamically testing your software for vuln?
	
There is a difference between someone who only "codes" and becomes institutionalized
vs someone who considers new approaches to solving problems
